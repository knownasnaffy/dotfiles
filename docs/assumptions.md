# Use-case assumptions

- Wayland-first system; X11 exists only via XWayland for legacy apps
- Hyprland is the sole compositor and window manager
- Laptop-focused system (internal display is primary, hotplug is secondary)
- Scaling, input, and power management are optimized for laptop usage
- Single-user system; no multi-seat or shared login scenarios
- Private PC; no enterprise constraints or managed environment assumptions
